<h1 align="center"> Stress Buddy - QDS </h1> 

## Project Description
Stress Buddies is a useful app for students dealing with challenging assignments and heavy workloads. By connecting students with different strengths and weaknesses, it not only eases mental stress but also provides the flexibility to spend more time on other activities or get a good night's sleep. This focus on mental well-being ultimately contributes to improved physical health, allowing students to strike a better balance between academics and relaxation.

## Known Bugs and Limitations
* During development, due to limitations of the MongoDB database, it was necessary to create and switch between two databases, which resulted in additional complexity.

* While creating a matching collection, it was anticipated that it would facilitate algorithm optimization. However, due to constraints in time and resources, we couldn't execute the plan as thoroughly as desired.


## Features for Future
* AI Matchmaking for Learning: Integrate AI matchmaking functionality to pair users with AI when there are no matches available. This allows users to study with the assistance of AI, enhancing their learning experience.

* Points System and Leaderboard: Implement a points system where users earn points by helping others or receiving assistance. These points can be used to climb the leaderboard, encouraging users to actively participate and engage in the community.
